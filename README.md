# TV Script Generation

## Introduction

In this project, we'll generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

## Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch), in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using
``
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
``

You may also choose to complete your project using the provided, in-classroom project notebook; this will just require that you run the project notebook, and download the complete files, as specified below.
